Description: This is a tutorial for characterizing sequences of IAV HA proteins using only ***online-based*** tools. All of these tools exist offline and will be useful when dealing this larger scale projects. For now, we will focus on learning the concepts for these tools with "user-friendly" versions. 

## Step 1 Downloading Sequences W
### Download H3N2 and IAV HA sequences from NCBI or GISAID (if you have access) 

1.	Navigate to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/popset/1327835100

2.	Select “Send To” and chose File -> Format “FASTA” and Create File
        a.	The file will be downloaded by default as “sequence.fasta”. Rename this so that we don’t lose track of it to “ H3N2_HA_ popset-1327835100.fasta”. Move it to a new folder an name it “H3N2 practice sequences”. We will keep everything in this folder which can also be referred to as a directory. 

3. Navigate to [NextClade](https://clades.nextstrain.org)
    - **_IMPORTANT_**: Use Chrome when using NextClade, other browsers may not be supported.
